#####In teams of two, address the following questions:

#####What species (and location if available) did you choose? Why did you choose the species? We chose the 
What question do you want to answer about this population (e.g. population status, best management strategies)?
######Calculate eigenvalue, stable age distribution, elasticity, and sensitivity. What does this tell you about the population?
Using the calculations in part (c), or additional calculations, address the question you proposed in part (b).
######Submit your writeup as an R markdown file on Github. This can be a private or public repository. I expect to see commits to the repository from each partner.

```{r}

# dataComadre<-comadre$metadata$CommonName
grep(comadre$metadata$Order, pattern= 'Lepidoptera') #search by order

comadre$mat[845][[1]]$matA #alexandras sulphur butterfly
aMatrix<-comadre$mat[845][[1]]$matA
print(aMatrix)
library(demogR)
help(package="demogR")

#Eigenvalue analysis
analysis<-eigen.analysis(aMatrix)

#asymptotic growth rate: lambda
analysis$lambda1
# 1.416025
# Greater than 1 means the population is growing exponentially

# Stable age distribution
analysis$stable.age
#[1] 0.577948350 0.253786641 0.107176347 0.042884913 0.014779283 0.002264864
#[7] 0.001159602

# This tells us that most of the population is in the first stage (eggs) and few hatch and then subsequently make it to adulthood.
